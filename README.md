Description:

Project Topic - Disaster Loss Analysis Using Social Media Data

Summary - Social media has become ubiquitous in content sharing and networking. In disaster-stricken areas, social media is often used as a real-time and resourceful backchannel for vital information dissemination and active communications. 
    
    These user-generated texts and multimedia messages have a plethora of critical disaster-related pieces of information and rapid, accurate, and helpful suggestions for disaster response embedded within, which, if harnessed, can be utilized as actions toward disaster mitigation. 
    
    This project aims to extract and evaluate the information specific to disaster losses (such as information on trapped, missing, dead, and injured people and infrastructure and utility damage as well as other cautionary or voluntary information) that would positively help disaster management. Through this project, we study a method to extract disaster-loss information from social media platforms such as Twitter in the form of tweets (textual data). Furthermore, we wish to utilize this data to analyze the losses that occurred for practical and reflective analysis and visualization of the disaster by applying supervised Machine Learning classification methods.
